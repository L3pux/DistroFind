# DistroFind
A discord bot that scraps distrowatach.

## Self hosting:
To use the bot you can either add it to your server (I'm not hosting it yet) or self host it in your computer or a host.

1- Make your bot, Copy the token then paste it in "client.run('YOUR_TOKEN_HERE')" (replace *YOUR_TOKEN_HERE* with your actual token)
## Bot commands:

$find [distro_name]: It'll find basic info of the distro.

$explain [distro_name]: It'll find the description of the distro.

$random: It'll find the basic info for a random distro (Note: It the distro info from the top 100 distros in distrofind main page)

$lgoo [distro_name]: It'll find the logo of the distro (Ignore for now: It won't work becasue discord won't display the URL and an image)
